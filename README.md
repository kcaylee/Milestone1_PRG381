# 🔐 User Authentication Web Application

This project was developed as part of a milestone for **PRG381**, with the goal of building a web application featuring **user authentication functionality**, including **login** and **registration**.

## 🌐 Project Overview

This web application demonstrates the integration of front-end and back-end components using **Java technologies**, while securely interacting with a **PostgreSQL** database to manage user credentials.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java Server Pages (JSP):**  
  For building and structuring the user interface.

- **Java Servlets:**  
  Handle server-side logic, process requests, and communicate with the database.

- **PostgreSQL:**  
  Stores user credentials securely and supports authentication operations.

- **Apache Tomcat / GlassFish:**  
  Used for deploying the application in a robust and scalable environment.

## 🛡️ Key Features

- 👤 **User Registration:**  
  Allows users to create new accounts with secure data storage.

- 🔐 **User Login:**  
  Authenticates users based on their stored credentials.

- 💾 **Database Integration:**  
  Reads/writes user data to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.

- 📦 **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data handling.

## ✅ Summary

This project emphasizes a **secure**, **modular**, and **scalable** approach to building foundational user authentication systems in web applications. It effectively integrates JSP, Servlets, and PostgreSQL into a cohesive architecture.
